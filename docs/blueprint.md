## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#328378) to inspire confidence and calm, without resorting to overly corporate cliches.
- Background color: Soft light grey (#F0F2F5) that visually integrates the white space and the light of the application. The hue is related to the teal, but very desaturated and very bright.
- Accent color: Sea green (#5DAB98), a vibrant shade of green that stands out from the teal.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif that conveys both a personal touch and artistic design.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a classic serif font suitable for continuous reading. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent property types, amenities, and actions.
- Implement a responsive layout with clear sections for easy navigation.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience.
